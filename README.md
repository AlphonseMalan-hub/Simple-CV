## <a name="what-is-awesomecv"></a>What is Simple CV?

**Simple CV** is a LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** based on [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). The class files are written so that it should be easy to modify the template as you see fit. Example source files and the resulting PDFs are located in `examples`.

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``.
